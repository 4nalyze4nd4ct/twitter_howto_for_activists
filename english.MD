# Short handout for using Twitter at events

##1 - Timestamps
Pleas use timestamps, e.g. [22:04] or 2204 - So that messages like "it is escalating" are always up to date and don't cause reactions hours later.
Otherways it is a cause of tense atmosphere for people who follow these events for longer periods of time..

##2 - Hashtags
Please don't use hashtags for ideological stuff, ranting, trolling or deeper meanings.
You can do this without hashtags as well.
It will be easier for people to get informations, and keep things clean and accurately.

### Suggestion
Event[Day] - For example: #Heidenau2208 <-- Only things that happened on this day, no comments or so, only the real, usable facts.

##3 - Retweets
Before retweeting: Check who postet the original tweet, and why did he do this?
You have to recoginze false flag postings, don't retweet this without thinking about them first.
Check if the original accounts where created solely for the purpose of creating atmosphere pro/against something.
Indicators: The account has no profile picture, or very few followers, or there are other things which seem to be strange.
If unsure, there is a rule that is used by journalists: Check if there are other sources of this information, at least from 3 other accounts.

##4 - Pictures
Please obfuscate your people on posted photos. Sometimes pictures are posted without thinking about it, and they spread very wide.
There are apps like ObscuraCam for android to blur faces of people on the photos. (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.witness.sscphase1&feature=search_result).
Unfortunately we don't know about such apps for the iPhone.

In case of repression, there won't be any evidence for investigation.
Encrypt your devices, if they are confiscated, stolen or simply if you lose them.

##5 - Keep calm
When there is lots of action going on, only post new informations under the #hashtag to your timeline.
Get yourself a look over the whole situation, sometimes a heaty situation calms down very fast after some minutes, a Tweet with lots of action does not.
Please update your timeline with a new Tweet when the situation calms down.

Don't get molested.
If people tweet about events, and are retweeted, there may be Nazis or trolls on twitter who react molesting.
Get over it, don't let them provoke you.
If it gets too much: Shut down Twitter for some time.
Maybe set your account to private for some time.
You can't retweet private accounts, but it is still possible to get informations out to your followers.

##6 - No tactical informations for the enemy
Unterlasst Posts wie "Fahren jetzt mit Auto Kolonne weg/hin" oder Ã¤hnliches.
Please don't post things like "We're arriving/leaving with the crew now".
This endangers people. Don't post exact people counts. When it is known that there are only ten people at the event, this information can be used for attacks. 
Chose things like "We need support at the site" over "We are two people here, trying to protect the refugee camp."
